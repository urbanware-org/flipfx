## Definition

The *FlipFX* module allows printing a string with a flipping character effect.

:keyboard: If you are also interested in a typewriter effect text printer module, you can find it [here](https://github.com/urbanware-org/typefx).

## Details

Before the given string is printed, a random one with the same length will be created and printed. With a user-defined delay the characters will flip randomly until all of them are identical with the given one.

**Usage example:**

Code:

```python
import flipfx
flipfx.charflip("This is an example how the module works.", 80)
```

Output:
