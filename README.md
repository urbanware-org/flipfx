## Definition

The *FlipFX* module allows printing a string with a flipping character effect.

[Top](#flipfx)

## Details

Before the given string is printed, a random one with the same length will be created and printed. With a user-defined delay the characters will flip randomly until all of them are identical with the given one.

**Usage example:**

```python
import flipfx
flipfx.charflip("This is a simple text printed on the shell.", 0.08)
```

*   *Python* 2.x (version 2.7 or higher is recommended, may also work with earlier versions)
